# Simple-Console-Calculator

This project is a simple console based calculator. I published this project to understand the C# programming language better. If you notice any errors in the codes I wrote, please let me know.

I did this with a simple interface using Console, with the programming language being C#. I also provided a good environment using .Net technology.

Also this calculator is made with user friendly interface.

There are 7 files. If you want to try it, make sure you add the files correctly and also add them in the correct order to avoid confusion.
